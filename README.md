# IBE Mobile Application

A comprehensive mobile application built using **React Native** for managing employee workflows. The app includes key features such as **timesheet management**, **absence tracking**, **expense reporting**, and **approvals**, providing a streamlined experience for employees and managers alike.

- **Absence Tracking**: Request leaves, view leave balances, and track upcoming absences.
- **Expense Reporting**: Submit and manage expense claims, attach receipts, and track reimbursement statuses.
- **Approval Workflow**: Managers can review and approve or reject timesheets, absence requests, and expense reports directly from the app.

## Building the Application

To build the application for release using Expo, you can use **Expo's build service**.

### For iOS:

To build the iOS app, run the following command:
```bash
npx expo build:ios
```

This will guide you through the process of building the iOS app and generate a build that can be deployed to TestFlight.
